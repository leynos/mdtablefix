# Trailing spaces

`wrap_preserving_code` keeps trailing spaces on the final line. Markdown uses
two spaces at the end of a line to denote a hard break. Retaining trailing
spaces maintains fidelity when reflowing text so that hard breaks survive
wrapping.

See [issue #65](https://github.com/leynos/mdtablefix/issues/65) for more
details.
