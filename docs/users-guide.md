## Table reflow

`mdtablefix` reformats Markdown pipe tables so each column is aligned to a
uniform width. The formatter measures each cell using Unicode display width,
which means accented characters, CJK glyphs, and emoji stay visually aligned
after reflow.

Continuation rows are preserved during reflow. When a row starts with empty
leading cells because its content continues from the previous row, those empty
cells keep their original column positions instead of collapsing into the first
non-empty cell.

Literal pipe characters inside cells must be written as `\|`. `mdtablefix`
preserves that escaping during reflow, so a literal pipe remains part of the
cell content rather than being interpreted as a column boundary.

## Ellipsis handling

The `--ellipsis` flag replaces `...` inside table cells with the Unicode
ellipsis character `…` before the table is reflowed. This ensures column widths
are computed from the final emitted glyph rather than from the three-dot source
sequence.
