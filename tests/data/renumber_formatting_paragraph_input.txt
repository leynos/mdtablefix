When pytest-forked creates child processes, Slipcover's enhanced capabilities
ensure that:

1. Each forked child process independently collects coverage data for the tests
   it executes.

1. This data is temporarily stored.

1. Upon completion of all tests, the main Slipcover process aggregates the
   coverage data from all child processes into a single, unified dataset.

1. The final coverage report is generated from this aggregated data.
